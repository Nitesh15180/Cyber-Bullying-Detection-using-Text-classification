# Cyber-Bullying-Detection-using-Text-classification
Developed a Machine Learning model using the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify text as bullying or non-bullying, enhancing accuracy through data preprocessing and feature engineering.



Steps performed are as follow: 

#### 1) Data Collection
   
* Gather a labeled dataset with examples of both bullying and non-bullying text.

#### 2)Data Preprocessing

* Clean the text data (e.g., remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, tokenize).
* Perform text vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings).

 #### 3) Model Training

 * Split the data into training and testing sets.

* Train the SVM model on the training dataset using the preprocessed text features.

#### 4) Model Evaluation

 * Evaluate the trained SVM model on the testing dataset.
   
*  Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### 5) Streamlit Integration

 * Develop a Streamlit app that allows users to input text.

* Develop a Streamlit app that allows users to input text and receive real-time predictions.

  
#### 6) Deployment and Testing

* Deploy the Streamlit app for user access.
