# Cyber-Bullying-Detection-using-Text-classification
Developed a Machine Learning model using the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify text as bullying or non-bullying, enhancing accuracy through data preprocessing and feature engineering.



Steps performed are as follow: 

#### 1) Data Collection
   
* Gather a labeled dataset with examples of both bullying and non-bullying text.

#### 2)Data Preprocessing

Clean the text data (e.g., remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, tokenize).
Perform text vectorization (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings).
Model Training

#### 3) Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train the SVM model on the training dataset using the preprocessed text features.
Model Evaluation

#### 4) Evaluate the trained SVM model on the testing dataset.
   
Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Streamlit Integration

#### 5) Develop a Streamlit app that allows users to input text.

Develop a Streamlit app that allows users to input text and receive real-time predictions.
Deployment and Testing

Deploy the Streamlit app for user access.
Test the app with various inputs to ensure accurate classification and usability.
Integrate the trained SVM model into the Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
Deployment and Testing

#### 6) Deploy the Streamlit app for user access.
   
Test the app with various inputs to ensure accurate classification and usability.
